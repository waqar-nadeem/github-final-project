This is a basic calculator program that computes Simple Interest based on three inputs: principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

***Simple Interest is a way to calculate the interest charge on a loan or investment using the formula:
Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time***

Principal (p): The initial amount of money

Rate (r): The annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal or percentage)

Time (t): The time period in years

The program takes p, r, and t as inputs and returns the calculated simple interest.

Features:

Easy to use with clear input parameters

Accurate calculation using the standard formula

Suitable for educational and basic financial calculations

Usage:
Provide the following inputs: principal amount (p), time period in years (t), and annual rate of interest (r).
The program outputs the simple interest calculated as: Simple Interest = p × t × r

How to Run:
Run the program and enter the principal, rate, and time when prompted.
